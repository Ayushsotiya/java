for(int i=0;i<n;i++)now in this n means kitni vaar chalna chahiye 
(i=0;i<) es bich kitne no arhe hai utni vaar chalega


Actually mai bhot simple hai dont make it difficult , (n) where you need to write how many times do you need to run the loop
then (i) is the no. from where you need to start the count (how many no are there means this much times loop is running)

Trick - so if we start from the zero dont count the zero first count 1 to whereit is going and then add zero's no. 
 

ek chij or jis bhi no ka dekhna hai index yha kuch bhi dekho vo kon se no pai arha hai index uska ek kaam he hoga bass
